# react-tmg
React fundamentals via Tyler McGinnis, using hooks instead of classes (React 18).

## Important disclaimer
I'm not using branches the way they're meant to be used. You can check out main branch for day 1 fully annotated, and the next branches for day 2, 3, etc.

## Day 2
Have only been using `return` for elements and not at all inside 'handler' functions.
So much better with hooks because you don't have to deal with the need to .bind anything (classes usage).
